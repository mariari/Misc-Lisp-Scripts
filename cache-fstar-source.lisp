;; This does not work for ulib sadly, it has many finicky parameters see here
;; https://github.com/FStarLang/FStar/issues/1790
;; for some reason if you qualify the entire file instead of assuming current file, it
;; may fail with errors (looking at you FStar.Seq.Base.fst)
;; , this script does not account for that. Please fix those ones manually,
;; or add custom lisp logic to solve that certain case!!!!!!
