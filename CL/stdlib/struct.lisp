;;;; old idea that I would like the answer to sometime
;; FIX ME, for some reason I can't overset the default getters and setters
;; I tired to ways of solving the problem below

;; the first uses setf and not inling the functions to get the effect
;; this approach has the issue of using the old definition for some reason
;; it's bizarre

;; the second makes a new function of the same name and unbinds the original
;; this second method gets stuck in infinite recursion of calling itself over and over
